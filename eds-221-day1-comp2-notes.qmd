## Notes

we'll be using janitor clean names right out of the gate -- put everything in lower snake case

using here() function:

toolik_weather \<- read_csv(here::here("data", "data-raw", "toolik_weather.csv"))

\^ starts in working directory (can enter here() in console), "file", "next file", "document"
