## Notes

we'll be using janitor clean names right out of the gate -- put everything in lower snake case

janitor::clean_names()

using here() function:

toolik_weather \<- read_csv(here::here("data", "data-raw", "toolik_weather.csv"))

\^ starts in working directory (can enter here() in console), "file", "next file", "document"

-   use geom_jitter() to treat months as a non quantitative value -- don't want a line of diff points, want it jittered and not layered

?read_csv in console --\> na = c("", "NA")

we did read_csv(here::here("data", "data-raw", "toolik_weather.csv"), na = "#N/A")

?ggsave()
